## Grading Rubric 
## Data Preparation (15 points total)
- [ ]  [10 points] Define and prepare your class variables. 
- [ ]  Use proper variable representations (int, float, one-hot, etc.). 
- [ ]  Use pre-processing methods (as needed) for dimensionality reduction, scaling, etc. 
- [ ]  Remove variables that are not needed/useful for
the analysis.
- [ ]  [5 points] Describe the final dataset that is used for classification/regression (include a 
description of any newly formed variables you created). 
## Modeling and Evaluation (70 points total) 
- [ ]  [10 points] Choose and explain your evaluation metrics that you will use (i.e., accuracy, 
precision, recall, F-measure, or any metric we have discussed). 
- [ ]  Why are the measure(s) appropriate for analyzing the results of your modeling? 
- [ ]  Give a detailed explanation backing up any assertions. 
- [ ]  [10 points] Choose the method you will use for dividing your data into training and 
testing splits (i.e., are you using Stratified 10-fold cross validation? Why?). 
- [ ]  Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate. 
- [ ]  [20 points] Create three different classification/regression models (e.g., random forest, 
KNN, and SVM). 
- [ ]  Two modeling techniques must be new (but the third could be SVM or 
logistic regression). 
- [ ]  Adjust parameters as appropriate to increase generalization performance using your chosen metric.   
- [ ]  [10 points] Analyze the results using your chosen method of evaluation. 
- [ ]  Use visualizations of the results to bolster the analysis. Explain any visuals and analyze why 
they are interesting to someone that might use this model. 
- [ ]  [10 points] Discuss the advantages of each model for each classification task, if any. 
- [ ]  If there are not advantages, explain why. Is any model better than another? 
- [ ]  Is the difference significant with 95% confidence? 
- [ ]  Use proper statistical comparison methods. 
- [ ]  [10 points] Which attributes from your analysis are most important? 
- [ ]  Use proper methods discussed in class to evaluate the importance of different attributes. 
- [ ]  Discuss the results and hypothesize about why certain attributes are more important than others 
for a given classification task. 
## Deployment (5 points total) 
- [ ]  [5 points] How useful is your model for interested parties (i.e., the companies or 
organizations that might want to use it for prediction)? 
- [ ]  How would you measure the model's value if it was used by these parties? 
- [ ]  How would your deploy your model for interested parties? 
- [ ]  What other data should be collected? How often would the model 
need to be updated, etc.? 
## Exceptional Work (10 points total) 
- [ ]  You have free reign to provide additional modeling.  
- [ ]  One idea: grid search parameters in a parallelized fashion and visualize the 
performances across attributes. 
- [ ]  Which parameters are most significant for making a good model for each classification algorithm?
