### (Milan Patel) Need more Visuals (more confusion matrixes, visualizations of the results)
### (Milan Patel) Modeling and Evaluation 4
### (Tadd Backus) Modeling and Evaluation 6 needs to be done
### talk to the different methods (test/train, cross validation, Stratified CV)? Maybe
### (Tadd Backus) Deployment needs to be worked, add info on why one method was chosen over the others
### (Kendall Scott) 3 Regression models--  random forest, knn, linear
Elevation can be predicted using this dataset, by leveraging a linear regression model. Model performance will be measured using.
RMSE (Root mean squared error)
To measure the difference between predictions and actual.
