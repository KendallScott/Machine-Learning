# Machine-Learning

Unit Assignments  
• Install all required packages on your development system (Linux, Mac or, if need be, 
Windows)   
• Linux and mac will be slightly better operating systems when working with the 
packages in this class. Although Windows will be fine for the majority of cases, some 
packages run more slowly or are not optimized for this OS.  
• Have an idea about the dataset you would like to use during the semester  
• During Live Session:   
• Introductions  
• Introduce course grading schema   
• Dataset selection: have a brief explanation of your data, how you plan to preprocess it, and 
why it is useful for third parties  
• Pay attention and start to feel around for others to work with on teams during 
semester. Teams are due by next week!!  
• Come with questions about the Pandas ecosystem and variable representations!  
• In-class example: what is Numpy and why do we use it? This is example E00 on the course 
github page.  
 
 
## Dataset Selection for Semester  
 
You will select (as a team) which dataset you wish to work on during the semester. You have a 
lot of free reign for the analysis, but the dataset must be sufficiently complex.  
This means:   
1. there must be 10 or more attributes for analyzing the data (both continuous and discrete),   
2. there must be at least 30,000 records to classify in the data, and  
3. there must be a good documentation of the dataset attributes. 
 
Select a classification dataset from one of the following sources:   
• Public Record: Chosen from a public repository. Some examples include the Dallas Crime 
dataset, UCI machine learning repository, and many others.    
• Kaggle: This website hosts machine learning competitions with prizes to the best 
performers. You can choose one of the open and enterable competitions-as long as it meets 
the criteria for complexity outlined above.   
• Note: you need to sign up to use Kaggle. Many of the competitions require more 
than just machine learning to solve. For instance, it is usually up to you to get the 
dataset in a format that is readable for python. Additionally, you may need to extract 
features to use (e.g., they give you images and expect you to process the images 
and extract features).   
• This option is probably more work than the others but has more reward also.   
• As students, you usually qualify for getting additional prizes and/or job offers, so 
keep this kind of thing in mind for the future, even if you do not use it for class.  
• Your Own: If you want to use data from your own research or data that you have collected, 
that's fine. It still must meet the above-mentioned criteria. Verify your dataset with the 
instructor before choosing this option!
