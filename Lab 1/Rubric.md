## Here is the rubric I will be using to grade Lab 1.  
You must have these exact sections in your project, if you want me to grade it!  
Lab 1 is due Sunday, 01/22/2023 by 11:59PM.

## Business Understanding 10 points
#### Kendall
- [x]  Describe the purpose of the data set you selected (i.e., why was this data collected in the first place?). 
- [x]  Describe how you would define and measure the outcomes from the dataset. 
- [x]  That is, why is this data important and how do you know if you have mined useful knowledge from the dataset? 
- [x]  How would you measure the effectiveness of a good prediction algorithm? Be specific.
## Data Meaning Type 10	points
#### Kendall
- [x]  Describe the meaning and type of data (scale, values, etc.) for each attribute in the data file.
## Data Quality	15 points
#### Kendall
- [x]  Verify data quality: Explain any missing values, duplicate data, and outliers. 
- [x]  Are those mistakes? 
- [x]  How do you deal with these problems? 
- [x]  Give justifications for your methods.

## Simple Statistics 10	points 

#### Tadd
- [x]  Visualize appropriate statistics (e.g., range, mode, mean, median, variance, counts) for a subset of attributes. 
- [x]  Describe anything meaningful you found from this or if you found something potentially interesting. 
- [x]  Note: You can also use data from other sources for comparison. 
- [x]  Explain why the statistics run are meaningful. 
## Visualize Attributes	15 points

####  Everyone does 1-2 graphs with paragraph
- [ ]  Visualize the most interesting attributes (at least 5 attributes, your opinion on what is interesting). 
- [ ]  Important: Interpret the implications for each visualization. 
- [ ]  Explain for each attribute why the chosen visualization is appropriate.
## Explore Joint Attributes 15 points

####  Tadd and Milan
- [ ]  Visualize relationships between attributes: 
- [ ]  Look at the attributes via scatter plots, correlation, cross-tabulation, group-wise averages, etc. as appropriate. 
- [ ]  Explain any interesting relationships.
## Explore Attributes and Class	10 points
####  Andrew
- [x]  Identify and explain interesting relationships between features and the class you are trying to predict (i.e., relationships with variables and the target classification).
## New Features	5	points
#### Kendall

- [ ] Are there other features that could be added to the data or created from existing features? Which ones?
## Exceptional Work	10 points

## Andrew? maybe pca maybe not/Maybe Kendall
- [x]  You have free reign to provide additional analyses. One idea: implement dimensionality reduction, then visualize and interpret the results.
